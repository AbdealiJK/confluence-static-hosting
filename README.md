# Confluence Static Hosting

This project aims to take a Confluence website and host is staticly independent of Confluence.
This is a very useful method of deploying documentation and webpages which can be developed
using Confluence's rich editoing functionality - and exporting as a static website.

Similar Alternatives:
 - `HTML Export in Confluence` - This is useful for simple websites. It is not rich in metadata,
   nor does it help in structuring the data differently. Making it difficult to use with good themeing.
 - `Instant Websites for Confluence` - This is useful for hosting a confluence publicly. The issue here
   is the static website is hosted on the S3 which is not controlled by us, and the website HAS to be
   public. [marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214121/instant-websites-for-confluence)
 - `Native Confluence Support` - This is under discussion in the JIRA ticket
